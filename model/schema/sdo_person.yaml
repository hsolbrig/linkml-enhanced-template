      The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes,
      UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings
      or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.

enums:
  gender_enum:
    description: |-
      Gender of something, typically a Person, but possibly also fictional characters, animals, etc.
      While https://schema.org/Male and https://schema.org/Female may be used, text strings are also acceptable
      for people who do not identify as a binary gender. The gender property can also be used in an extended
      sense to cover e.g. the gender of sports teams. As with the gender of individuals, we do not try to
      enumerate all possibilities. A mixed-gender SportsTeam can be indicated with a text value of "Mixed".
